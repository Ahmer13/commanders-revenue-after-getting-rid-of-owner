# 🏈 Commanders Revenue Boost — Case Study

## Overview
As a **lifelong Washington Commanders fan**, I’ve been through the highs and lows — from the Mark Brunell and Jason Campbell years, to John Beck’s brief stint under center, to the inspiring Alex Smith comeback, and the gritty Taylor Heinicke run. Each era had its moments, but inconsistent quarterback play and unstable ownership kept the team from reaching its full potential — both on the field and in revenue growth.

With the arrival of **Jayden Daniels** and a new ownership group, this project explores how these changes could impact **ticket sales, merchandise revenue, and overall franchise valuation**.

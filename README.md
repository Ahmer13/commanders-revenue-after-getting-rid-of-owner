# 🏈 Commanders Revenue Boost: A Case Study from a Fan who has endured a lot of pain

I’ve been riding with the Washington Commanders through every high, low, and heartbreak — from the grit of Mark Brunell’s playoff push in ’05, the promise of Jason Campbell, the comeback of Alex Smith, the spark of Taylor Heinicke, and yes… even the John Beck era.  

I’ve sat through freezing FedEx Field nights, watched us cycle through head coaches like clockwork, and endured the controversies of Dan Snyder’s ownership — all while knowing that this franchise has one of the most passionate fan bases in football, if only it had the leadership to match.  

Now, with **Jayden Daniels under center** and a **new ownership group** breathing life into the building, there’s a golden opportunity to turn this team’s momentum into serious revenue growth. This project is my deep dive into how improved quarterback play, organizational competence, and renewed fan trust can boost the Commanders’ bottom line.

## 📖 Mini Stories (STAR Method)

### **1. Analyzing Past Declines**
- **Situation:** Under Snyder’s final seasons, the team saw declining attendance, empty lower bowls, and stagnant ticket revenue despite NFL-wide growth.
- **Task:** Quantify just how much the dysfunction was costing.
- **Action:** Collected season-by-season attendance data, resale ticket prices, and even looked at TV ratings dips during key games.
- **Result:** Found that revenue potential was being held back by **15–20% annually** compared to similar-market franchises.

### **2. Projecting the Jayden Daniels Effect**
- **Situation:** Commanders draft Jayden Daniels — Heisman winner, dynamic playmaker, and a shot of adrenaline to the franchise.
- **Task:** Forecast the financial impact if Daniels can produce winning seasons.
- **Action:** Modeled attendance jumps, ticket price elasticity, and jersey sales surges tied to star QB performance.
- **Result:** Projected **10–15% ticket price growth** and a **25% spike in merchandise sales** by Daniels’ second season.

### **3. Measuring the Ownership Reset**
- **Situation:** Snyder out, Harris Group in — trust in the franchise skyrockets overnight.
- **Task:** Translate this morale shift into dollars.
- **Action:** Studied ownership change case studies (e.g., Carolina Panthers under Tepper, Golden State Warriors pre-dynasty).
- **Result:** Identified a **$50M+ revenue growth path over 3 years** if new ownership sustains fan goodwill and team performance.

# 🏈 Commanders Revenue Boost: A Case Study

As a lifelong Washington Commanders fan, I’ve seen quarterbacks come and go — from Mark Brunell and Jason Campbell to Alex Smith, Taylor Heinicke, and even John Beck. Each era brought hope, but often, the team’s on-field struggles and ownership controversies overshadowed potential revenue growth.

With the arrival of Jayden Daniels and new ownership, the Commanders have a fresh chance to rebuild both their reputation and their revenue. This project analyzes how improved leadership, performance, and fan engagement could drive a significant financial turnaround.

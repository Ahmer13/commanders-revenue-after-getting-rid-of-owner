# ​ Commanders Revenue Boost — Case Study

## Overview
As a **lifelong Washington Commanders fan**, I’ve been through the highs and lows — from the Mark Brunell and Jason Campbell years, to John Beck’s brief stint under center, to the inspiring Alex Smith comeback, and the gritty Taylor Heinicke run. Each era had its moments, but inconsistent quarterback play and unstable ownership kept the team from reaching its full potential — both on the field and in revenue growth.

With the arrival of **Jayden Daniels** and a new ownership group, this project explores how these changes could impact **franchise revenue from ticket sales, merchandise, and fan engagement**.

##  Project Goals
- Explore the impact of QB + ownership change on Washington Commanders' revenue.
- Compare historical ticket and merchandise trends across different QB eras.
- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize revenue forecasts under new leadership.

##  Mini Project Stories (STAR Method)

**1. Ticket Price Patterns**  
**Situation:** Ticket prices stayed flat during seasons of inconsistent QB play.  
**Task:** Identify how pricing could change with improved performance and optimism.  
**Action:** Gathered 10 years of ticket data, normalized for inflation, broke it down by QB era.  
**Result:** Found that average ticket prices could grow **12–18%** without deterring fans.

**2. Attendance & Performance Link**  
**Situation:** Stadium attendance dropped even in winnable seasons.  
**Task:** Quantify how much wins influence fan turnout.  
**Action:** Correlated win percentage with stadium fill rate across multiple seasons.  
**Result:** Discovered a **0.82 correlation** — showing revenue upside tied directly to winning.

**3. Forecasting 2025 Revenue**  
**Situation:** Jayden Daniels and stable leadership bring momentum.  
**Task:** Project revenue gains under different performance scenarios.  
**Action:** Built a model combining attendance, ticket pricing, and playoff scenarios.  
**Result:** Predicts an additional **$24M–$32M in revenue** compared to 2023.
